I am not going to lie this CLI project was very difficult for me. I was a week behind the program due to not feeling well and I spent all of project week doing the previous lessons. I finally got to the project on Friday and stuggled to get it to the deadline. I wish the circumstances weren't how they were. I think I actually learned a lot with this project and got comfortable with many techniques. I got more comfortable with OO ruby as a whole and now believe whenever I have to tackle something like this again I should be set. I think that if I can do something like this in a couple days, a week should be easier for me to handle (fingers crossed). I also believe I got more comfortable with scraping and think next time I need to scrape some data using "Nokogiri" it should be cake!

All in all I think that seeing how someone performs in pressuring and stressful situations is good for the soul and character. I would not like to be feeling the amount of anxiety I experience during this again, however I am glad this is something I'm going through because I believe it will make me a better person and hopefully... a better coder!!!!

Thank you <3
