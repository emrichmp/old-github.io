My software journey started in High School. My school offered a class in game design which used a language called processing. I have always been into technology but when I was in Syracuse University I did not enjoy computer science there. I thought I would keep pushing and it would all be okay, however things would change. School became too expensive and I transferred to City Tech in New York City. I still did not enjoy the way university taught coding. This is when I found out about the FlatIron school and decided to give it a shot.

That is my journey to now but my motive to pursue these studies remains the same. Since a young age I have been into STEM related subjects and Software Engineering just happened to be the one that clicked for me the most. Additionally to put it bluntly I want money. I feel like I can make a good career in the software field and I can see myself enjoying a job in the field.
