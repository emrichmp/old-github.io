This Sinatra Project has not been easy and definetly a bigger challenge compared to the CLI project. I think what I loved most about module 2 and the Sinatra Project is that it finally gives me some foresight on what is to come once it is time to enter the job field. I see the real world use of what we are learning and how we can apply these principles to our own future applications or for companies

To get more into the technical aspect of things, I would like to explain the challenges I had to overcome. I struggled at first with the idea of implementing different "languages" in this project. I found writing HTML was very tedious and time consuming and pairing that with having to use '<%= code %>' was something that was difficult to wrap my head around. Eventually it became easier for me, especially when I started using "shotgun" a little more intuitively to see how my changes in the raw HTML effected the web apps layout. Further more I had trouble using rake. Even when we were learning rake I had difficulty understanding when to migrate, why, or the point of using it in the first place. Once I started doing this project I saw how it made things easier. Migrating with rake and being able to see how the project progressed and check when I made what edits was very helpful. Being able to check back and see made it easier for me to find mistakes when I accidentally added rows and columns that I did prior. I think all around I struggled with most concepts but being able to go through the code and get more comfortable by practice helped me a lot when developing this project.

All in all this Sinatra Project was a great next step towards my understanding of APIs. A challenging and valuable learning experience without a doubt!
