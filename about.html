<p>Full stack web developer with a hunger for problem solving. A graduate of the FlatIron School with a passion for strength and conditioning coaching. Growing up I was in love with science and technology as a kid and that enthusiasm fell off when I started studying computer science in college. After a year hiatus from higher education I decided to give coding another shot. My experience in strength programming lent itself to immersion in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and Redux. Meanwhile my experience in building client relationships evokes relentless drive to problem solve.</p>
